Adds stuff from bakalari to google calendar

This application uses google calendar API v3 in order to add school classes from a popular Czech website called Bakalari, into your google calendar.

It also has an online version, on the website https://bakalaricz.herokuapp.com where you choose your classes and my script adds the code to your google calendar.
